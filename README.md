# 🧩 JavaScript Array Methods Exercises

A collection of **JavaScript array manipulation challenges** built as part of my learning journey through *The Odin Project* and *The Modern JavaScript Tutorial*.  
Each folder inside the `ArrayMethods/` directory contains one exercise with its own solution file and test examples.

The exercices come from the site: https://javascript.info/array-methods#tasks |

TOP page: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-loops-and-arrays 

This is the way that I solved the problems shown.
